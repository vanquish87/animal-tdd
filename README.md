# Python-CodeScreen-Animal-Farm

You are required to implement all the functions in the [animal_farm.py](src/animal_farm.py) file.
These methods support queries counting the number of animals in various enclosures on a large enterprise farm.

The unit tests in the [test/test_animal_farm.py](test/test_animal_farm.py) file should pass if the functions in [animal_farm.py](src/animal_farm.py) are implemented correctly.

Note that there is a time limit on our unit tests for the `count` function, so (**hint**), if you try to sum the number of animals in `count`, it will timeout.

## Requirements

The [test/test_animal_farm.py](test/test_animal_farm.py) file should not be modified. If you would like to add your own unit tests, you can add these in a separate file in the `test` directory.

The [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file should only be modified in order to add any third-party dependencies required for your solution. Please note that all third-party dependencies required for your solution **MUST** be added to the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file, otherwise our GitHub Actions workflow that validates your solution will not pass.

The `pytest` version should not be changed.

Your solution must use/be compatible with `Python version 3.10`.

Good luck!
